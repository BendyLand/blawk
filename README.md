# blawk

A custom suite of text tools inspired by `awk`. 

## Purpose

My goal is to create a C library API that can be used as a part of other programs, 
which resembles the behavior of the utilities found in `awk`. 

## About

The idea for this project came from the desire to use tools similar to `awk` as code 
from within my own other projects. 

Additionally, I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of text processing at a 
lower level. That is why this project will be written in C (that, and it is a 
chance for me to test out my other tools, like blrun and blfmt, which are coming
along *very* nicely üòÅ).

## Name

Since my running theme is to add bl- to general concepts, 
I figured this could be a nice, quick way to convey what the tool does, 
without spending too much time on the name. 
A bit of an homage to the original, if you will.  
***Not*** meant to replace it though.
